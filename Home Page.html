                        Since Times immemorial the hills of this region have attracted tourists and pilgrims from the
                        world over. Tourism in #Uttrakhand has been envisaged to become the most important industry of
                        the state employing a significant majority of people directly and indirectly with a major
                        contribution to the state economy. Uttrakhand awesome beauty and calm of the stately Himalayas
                        is a virtual paradise for tourists. The dream of this newly formed state is to make Uttrakhand
                        as the most favored destination of travelers from within and abroad. Uttrakhand abounds in
                        places of sanctity; age-old pilgrim centers the famous Char Dham, Hemkund Sahib, #Haridwar,
                        Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, the Panch Kedar, Panch Bari & Panch Prayag, where the devout Hindus,
                        Sikh & other communities converge to pay obeisance & feel closet to celestial beings.
                        In Hindu Mythology Lord Vishnu is known as Hari & Shiva as Har. Dwar means gate and that is the
                        reason that this place is known as #Hardwar or #Haridwar, as the gateway to the Four
                        Shrines/Dham of Uttrakhand. Mentioned as Mayapuri, Gangadwar, Mokhsadwar in the ancient
                        scriptures & epic. Haridwar always reminds us of major #Shaktipeeth for the devotees. Legend has
                        it that the holy Ganga, the holiest of all rivers, which flows through this sacred city has
                        actually been sanctified by the powerful Trinity of Hindu mythology & the center of the Pantheon
                        Brahma, Vishnu & Mahesh. According to devotees, Haridwar is one of the four places (other three
                        being Ujjain, Nasik, & Allahabad) upon which the Amrit-Nector of immortality emerging out of the
                        churning ocean fell. This is manifested in two great events that take place at Haridwar – the
                        memorable & the huge religious Mela Kumbh which happens once every 12 years & the Ardh Kumbh
                        Mela, which comes once every six years.
                        Well If you come to Haridwar for spiritual purpose then there are numerous places<a

                        <p>Daksha Mahadev Temple is a most prominent place of pilgrimage for Shaivaite, located in the
                                town of Kankhal, Haridwar of Uttarakhand. This is very historic temple and connected
                                with Lord Shiva and Goddess Sati. The Kankhal was the kingdom of the Raja Daksh and Sati
                                his daughter. Daksha Mahadev Temple is located at the site where a grand Yajna was
                                organised by the King Daksha in the past. Lord shiva and Devi Sati were not invited to
                                this Yajna despite the fact that Lord Shiva was Daksha’s son-in-law. It was this place
                                where Sati give up her life and Daksha’s was beheaded by Shiva’s gan. On regretting and
                                repenting, Daksha’s was given back life. It’s a very well maintained Temple and very
                                thin crowd.The temple houses the Yagna Kund wherein Sati Mata burnt herself. Adjacent to
                                the main temple on the right side is the Das Mahavidya temple of Kali, Tara, Shodashi,
                                Bhuvaneshvari, Bhairavi, Chhinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi, Matangi & Kamala. On the
                                left of the main temple is the Daksha Ghat where devotees take a dip in the holy Ganga
                                river. There are a few shops at the entrance of the premises which sell Rudraksh,
                                Shivlings, gems & stones. The peace & serenity as well as the holiness of this place
                                compels devotees to visit the temple each time.Daksha Mahadev Temple is about 6 kms from
                                Har-Ki-Pauri and Kankhal is very close to Haridwar.

                                        is a barrage on the Ganges River at Har ki Pauri near Haridwar in Haridwar
                                        district, Uttarakhand, India. Built as the headworks of the Upper Ganges Canal,

                                        completed in 1983. The primary purpose for the barrage is irrigation but it also
                                        serves to provide water for hydroelectric power production and control floods.
                                        The area behind the barrage is known as the Neel Dhara Bird Sanctuary and is a
                                        popular destination for various waterbirds and tourists.
